1 Test workflow
devtools::use_testthat(): (a)Create a tests/testthat directory. (b)Adds testthat to the Suggests field in the DESCRIPTION. (c) Creates a file tests/testthat.R that runs all your tests when R CMD check runs. (You’ll learn more about that in automated checking.)
devtools::test(): run test cases.

2 Test structure
expectations -> tests -> test files in "tests/testthat/"

3 Expectations
Many existing expectations come with the testthat package. But you can also customize your own test case throught "expect(...)".

4 Writing tests
Each test is run in its own environment and is self-contained. However, testthat doesn’t know how to cleanup after actions that affect the R landscape: (a)The filesystem: creating and deleting files, changing the working directory, etc. (b)The search path: library(), attach(). (c)Global options, like options() and par().
When you use these actions in tests, you’ll need to clean up after yourself.

5 Use "skip()" to skip a test

6 CRAN will run your tests on all CRAN platforms: Windows, Mac, Linux and Solaris in the English language (LANGUAGE=EN) and with C sort order (LC_COLLATE=C).  Use skip_on_cran() for long-running tests.
