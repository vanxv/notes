1 Object documentation is what you get when you call ? XXX or help().

2 It works like a dictionary, opposite to vignette.

3 They reside in the ".Rd" file in the "man/" folder.

4 While you can write the ".Rd" file yourself, roxygen2 makes it easier by formatting comment into ".Rd" files.

5 Two workflow to write documentation
In the first workflow, you can use devtools::document() (which calls roxygen2 to do the hard work) to generate ".Rd" files. Now, you can preview the documentation with ? or help.
In the second workflow, build&reload the package, and then preview the documentation. This needs some configuration.
The difference is that the second will show the links between packages.

6 Roxygen comments: TEXT part
Each block includes some TEXT before the first tag.1 This is called the introduction, and is parsed specially:
The first sentence becomes the title of the documentation. That’s what you see when you look at help(package = mypackage) and is shown at the top of each help file. It should fit on one line, be written in sentence case, but not end in a full stop.
The second paragraph is the description: this comes first in the documentation and should briefly describe what the function does.
The third and subsequent paragraphs go into the details: this is a (often long) section that is shown after the argument description and should go into detail about how the function works.

7 Roxygen comments: @section
You can add arbitrary sections to the documentation with the @section tag. This is a useful way of breaking a long details section into multiple chunks with useful headings. Section titles should be in sentence case, must be followed by a colon, and they can only be one line long.
#' @section Warning:
#' Do not operate heavy machinery within 8 hours of using this function.

8 Roxygen comments: @seealso and @family
#' @family aggregate functions
#' @seealso \code{\link{prod}} for products, \code{\link{cumsum}} for cumulative
#'   sums, and \code{\link{colSums}}/\code{\link{rowSums}} marginal sums over
#'   high-dimensional arrays.

9 Roxygen comments: @aliases and @ keywords
@aliases alias1 alias2 ... adds additional aliases to the topic. An alias is another name for the topic that can be used with ?.
@keywords keyword1 keyword2 ... adds standardised keywords. Keywords are optional, but if present, must be taken from a predefined list found in file.path(R.home("doc"), "KEYWORDS").
Generally, keywords are not that useful except for @keywords internal. Using the internal keyword removes the function from the package index and disables some of its automated tests. It’s common to use @keywords internal for functions that are of interest to other developers extending your package, but not most users.

10 Documenting functions
@param name description
You can document multiple arguments in one place by separating the names with commas (no spaces). For example, to document both x and y, you can write @param x,y Numeric vectors..
@examples Example code must work without errors as it is run automatically as part of R CMD check. \dontrun{} allows you to include code in the example that is not run.
@example path/relative/to/package/root to insert them into the documentation. (Note that the @example tag here has no ‘s’.)
@return description

11 Documenting datasets
See the data chapter.

12 Documenting package
There’s no object that corresponds to a package, so you need to document NULL, and then manually label it with @docType package and @name <package-name>. This is also an excellent place to use the @section tag to divide up page into useful categories.
#' foo: A package for computating the notorious bar statistic.
#'
#' The foo package provides three categories of important functions:
#' foo, bar and baz.
#' 
#' @section Foo functions:
#' The foo functions ...
#'
#' @docType package
#' @name foo
NULL
I usually put this documentation in a file called <package-name>.R. It’s also a good place to put the package level import statements that you’ll learn about in imports.
