1 Many existing packages have vignettes. You can see all the installed vignettes with browseVignettes(). To see the vignette for a specific package, use the argument, browseVignettes("packagename"). Each vignette provides three things: the original source file, a readable HTML page or PDF, and a file of R code. You can read a specific vignette with vignette(x), and see its code with edit(vignette(x)). 

2 Each vignette provides three things: the original source file, a readable HTML page or PDF, and a file of R code.

3 In this chapter, we’re going to use the R markdown vignette engine provided by knitr.

4 devtools::use_vignette("my-vignette")
This will:
Create a vignettes/ directory.
Add the necessary dependencies to DESCRIPTION (i.e. it adds knitr to the Suggests and VignetteBuilder fields).
Draft a vignette, vignettes/my-vignette.Rmd.
Once you have this file, the workflow is straightforward:
Modify the vignette.
Press Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + K (or click ) to knit the vignette and preview the output.

5 Metadata
Metadata is written in yaml. ">" indicates that the following lines of text are plain text, and shouldn't use any special yaml features. The date is filled in by default: it uses a special knitr syntax (explained below) to insert today’s date.
---
title: "Vignette Title"
author: "Vignette Author"
date: "`r Sys.Date()`"
output: rmarkdown::html_vignette
vignette: >
  %\VignetteIndexEntry{Vignette Title}
  %\VignetteEngine{knitr::rmarkdown}
  %\VignetteEncoding{UTF-8}
---
Output: this tells rmarkdown which output formatter to use. There are many options that are useful for regular reports (including html, pdf, slideshows, …) but rmarkdown::html_vignette has been specifically designed to work well inside packages.

7 Sections
Headings are identified by #:
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
Create a horizontal rule with three or more hyphens (or asterisks):
--------
********

8 Lists
Basic unordered lists use *:
* Bulleted list
* Item 2
    * Nested bullets need a 4-space indent.
    * Item 2b
If you want multiparagraph lists, the second and subsequent paragraphs need additional indenting:
  * It's possible to put multiple paragraphs of text in a list item. 

    But to do that, the second and subsequent paragraphs must be
    indented by four or more spaces. It looks better if the first
    bullet is also indented.
Ordered lists use: 1.:
1. Item 1
1. Item 2
1. Items are numbered automatically, even though they all start with 1.
You can intermingle ordered and bulleted lists, as long as you adhere to the four space rule:
1.  Item 1.
    *  Item a
    *  Item b
1.  Item 2.

9 Inline formatting
