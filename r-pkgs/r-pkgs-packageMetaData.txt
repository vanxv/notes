1 Dependency Management: Depends, Imports, and Suggests
These three fields differs in their strength of dependency.
"Depends" is the strongest one. Packages will be installed together with your package, and always be kept in the same state as your package (simultaneously installed, loaded, and attached).
"Imports" is the second strongest one. Installed together. If your package is loaded, these packages are not loaded. Your package is attached, these packages are loaded.
"Suggests" is the weakest one. Not installed along with your package. You need to check the state of these package yourself by "loadNamespace" or "requireNamespace".

2 Best practice: use Imports as possible and refer to externals by "pkg::func". And ONLY R appears in the "Depends" field as possible.

3 Version of dependents: best to specify the minimum version.

4 LinkingTo: packages listed here rely on C or C++ code in another package.

5 Enhances: a reverse of "Suggests". Not recommended to use.

6 List things that you package need outside R in the SystemRequirements. This is currently a plain text field and is not automatically checked.

7 Version of your package
An R package version is a sequence of at least two integers separated by either . or -.
Best Practice: <major>.<minor>.<patch> like 1.0.0 for release version; <major>.<minor>.<patch>.<in-development-version> for in-development package, where in-development-version starts with 9000.
Therefore, the first version of you package is 0.0.0.9000

8 "Collate" controls the order in which R files are sourced. By default, it is in alphabetical order.

9 "LazyData" controls if the data contained in data folder are loaded lazily.

10 You can also create your own fields to add additional metadata.
