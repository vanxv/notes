There are four other directories that are valid top-level directories. They are rarely used:

demo/: for package demos. These were useful prior to the introduction of vignettes, but are no longer recommended. See below.

exec/: for executable scripts. Unlike files placed in other directories, files in exec/ are automatically flagged as executable.

po/: translations for messages. This is useful but beyond the scope of this book. See the Internationalization chapter of “R extensions” for more details.

tools/: auxiliary files needed during configuration, or for sources that need to generate scripts.
